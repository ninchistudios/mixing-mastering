## Quick Tips

* Record at ~ -18dBFS (0dB VU). Recording hot is unnecessary with digital, and clipping over 0dBFS is unrecoverable.
* "That will be fixed in mastering" - no. Fix it in the mix. 
* Lowend VU tip: with kick drum kissing -3dB on VU, simultaneous kick and bass should kiss 0db VU to form a baseline balanced lowend for the mix. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECRx4WF3pcc
* 4dB tip: when trying to determine if a track is at the right volume, adjust it by 4dB and re-evaluate. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlY_Yxe0IVE
