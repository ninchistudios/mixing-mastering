# Music Production End to End Checklist

## Songwriting & Arrangement

These steps may occur in any order depending on your process.

### Hook

* The hook is one of the key ingredients of a memorable song
* It's possible to start writing a song from one phrase or word that forms the hook

### Lyrics

* Avoid cliche
* Songwriting references e.g. [Writing Better Lyrics](https://www.amazon.com.au/Writing-Better-Lyrics-Pat-Pattison-ebook/dp/B008Y0XH1C)

### Melody

Consider a Mode that suits the feel of the song, e.g.

1. Ionian (natural Major): Bright and happy, can be overly saccharine. Suits pop, rock, jazz, punk, country.
2. Dorian (natural Minor with a sharp 6th): Cheeky, partly sad, hopeful. Suits blues, jazz, rock, funk, prog.
3. Phrygian (natural Minor with a flat 2nd): Dark and tense. Spanish/oriental, suits metal, jazz, flamenco.
4. Lydian (natural Major with a sharp 4th): Mystical. Mostly used in jazz.
5. Mixolydian (natural Major with a flat 7th): Positive but edgy. Rock, blues, jazz, funk. The AC/DC progression.
6. Aeolian (natural Minor): Sad, subdued. Suits most genres.
7. Locrian (natural Major with flat 2nd and flat 5th): Dissonant, unstable, tense. 

Important to create a memorable melody.

### Chord Progression

### Arranging

Try to include something surprising or unique in the arrangement to create interest. Take the listener on a journey.

The song should grab the listener in the first verse/chorus.

Repetition is ok with a good arrangement. Even if the lyrics repeat, the arrangement should change and progress.

Some techniques:

* Vocal harmonies
* Vocal effects (radio/lofi, ring mod, etc)
* Percussion (bells, shakers etc)
* Synth instruments
* Strings and other orchestrals
* Doubled/tripled vocals
* Doubled guitars
* Time signature or tempo changes
* Key changes
* Quiet/highly simplified sections

## Production & Recording

* Mic placement is more important than mic choice.
* The analogue advice of recording at the highest possible level without clipping doesn't apply to digital. Record at -18dBFS on a VU without clipping.
* Don't "fix it in the mix" - originate the highest possible quality recordings.
* Lay down final MIDI arrangements if possible rather than placeholder. 
* Record MIDI notes with instruments (MIDI keys/pads/drums etc) rather than drawing notes if possible to humanise.
* Watch mic bleed from ambient sound and/or headphones when recording. Closed back cans preferred for vocalists.

### Basic Order for Rock

1. click track at target tempo
2. Rough simple take to the click track for arrangement reference
3. Percussion
4. Vocals
5. Rhythm instruments
6. Lead instruments
7. Others

## Editing & Mixing

### Edit

1. Gain stage to -18dBFS.
2. Create composite track from all takes for each track.
3. Clean up, tighten up and tune up each track.
4. Tune vocals.
5. Clean up breaths, smacks and plosives.
6. Quantize instruments judiciously - don't overdo and dehumanise it. Drums/bass can take/need more quantization than others.

### Mix

* Keep the Master bus clear so that the reference track is unaffected. Use a Mix Bus to glue the mix.

. Bring in a reference track, set level to -18 dBFS VU.
. Gain Stage check - the rough mix should sit about the same as 
. Mix Drums and bass at -21 dBFS VU until 
. Volume and Pan
. EQ
