# Music Production End to End Checklist

## Songwriting & Arrangement

These steps may occur in any order depending on your process.

### Hook

### Lyrics

### Melody


Consider a Mode that suits the feel of the song, e.g.

* Ionian (natural Major): Bright and happy, can be overly saccharine. Suits pop, rock, jazz, punk, country.
* Dorian (natural Minor with a sharp 6th): Cheeky, partly sad, hopeful. Suits blues, jazz, rock, funk, prog.
* Phrygian (natural Minor with a flat 2nd): Dark and tense. Spanish/oriental, suits metal, jazz, flamenco.
* Lydian (natural Major with a sharp 4th): Mystical. Mostly used in Jazz.
* Mixolydian (natural Major with a flat 7th): Positive but edgy. Rock, blues, jazz, funk. The AC/DC progression.
* Aeolian (natural Minor): Sad, subdued. Suits most genres.
* Locrian (natural Major with flat 2nd and flat 5th): Dissonant, unstable, tense.
