# Music Production End to End Checklist

## Songwriting & Arrangement

These steps may occur in any order depending on your process.

### Hook

* The hook is one of the key ingredients of a memorable song
* It's possible to start writing a song from one phrase or word that forms the hook

### Lyrics

* Avoid cliche
* Songwriting references e.g. [Writing Better Lyrics](https://www.amazon.com.au/Writing-Better-Lyrics-Pat-Pattison-ebook/dp/B008Y0XH1C)

### Melody

Consider a Mode that suits the feel of the song, e.g.

1. Ionian (natural Major): Bright and happy, can be overly saccharine. Suits pop, rock, jazz, punk, country.
2. Dorian (natural Minor with a sharp 6th): Cheeky, partly sad, hopeful. Suits blues, jazz, rock, funk, prog.
3. Phrygian (natural Minor with a flat 2nd): Dark and tense. Spanish/oriental, suits metal, jazz, flamenco.
4. Lydian (natural Major with a sharp 4th): Mystical. Mostly used in jazz.
5. Mixolydian (natural Major with a flat 7th): Positive but edgy. Rock, blues, jazz, funk. The AC/DC progression.
6. Aeolian (natural Minor): Sad, subdued. Suits most genres.
7. Locrian (natural Major with flat 2nd and flat 5th): Dissonant, unstable, tense. 

Important to create a memorable melody.

### Chord Progression

### Arranging

Try to include something surprising or unique in the arrangement to create interest. Take the listener on a journey.

The song should grab the listener in the first verse/chorus.

Repetition is ok with a good arrangement. Even if the lyrics repeat, the arrangement should change and progress.

Some techniques:

* Vocal harmonies
* Vocal effects (radio/lofi, ring mod, etc)
* Percussion (bells, shakers etc)
* Synth instruments
* Strings and other orchestrals
* Doubled/tripled vocals
* Doubled guitars
* Time signature or tempo changes
* Key changes
* Quiet/highly simplified sections

## Production & Recording

* Mic placement is more important than mic choice.
* The analogue advice of recording at the highest possible level without clipping doesn't apply to digital. Record at -18dBFS on a VU without clipping.
* Don't "fix it in the mix" - originate the highest possible quality recordings.
* Lay down final MIDI arrangements if possible rather than placeholder. 
* Record MIDI notes with instruments (MIDI keys/pads/drums etc) rather than drawing notes if possible to humanise.
* Watch mic bleed from ambient sound and/or headphones when recording. Closed back cans preferred for vocalists.

### Basic Order for Rock

1. click track at target tempo
2. Rough simple take to the click track for arrangement reference
3. Percussion
4. Vocals
5. Rhythm instruments
6. Lead instruments
7. Others

## Editing & Mixing

### Edit

1. Gain stage tracks to 0dB VU.
2. Create composite track from all takes for each track.
3. Clean up, tighten up and tune up each track.
4. Tune vocals.
5. Clean up breaths, smacks and plosives.
6. Quantize instruments judiciously - don't overdo and dehumanise it. Drums/bass can take/need more quantization than others.

### Mix

#### Tips

* Keep the Master bus clear (meter only) so that the reference track is unaffected. Use a Mix Bus to glue the mix.

#### Gain Staging with Basic Bus Layout

![Gain Staging with Basic Buses](https://github.com/ninchistudios/musicproduction/blob/master/gain-stage-buses.png "Gain Staging with Basic Buses")

#### Mixing Steps

. Create buses as above or as desired.
. Gain stage as above or as desired.
. Lowend Bus balance: with Drum Bus gained to -3dB VU on the kick, a simultaneous bass and kick hit should kiss 0dB VU on the Lowend Bus.
. Add a very conservative glue compressor/reverb on the Mix Bus.
. Bring in a professionally mastered reference track that sounds similar to what you're aiming for.
. Gain down the reference track so it VUs at a similar level as the Mix Bus.
. Volume and Pan TODO

##### Drums

* Use a signal generator, gated from the specific drum track, to add meat to a drum. ~50Hz works ok for a kick. e.g. Tone Gate in Reaper.
* Tape saturation can sound great on drums to give them a warm compression.

##### EQ

* Consider a light High Pass Filter on every track to remove mud. If you can notice the effect thinning the mix, it's too much.
